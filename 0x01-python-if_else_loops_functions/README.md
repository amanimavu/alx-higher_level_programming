# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This directory focuses on control flow tools such as condition statement, loops and the likes.
Some of the tools found in python are very similar to those know from other languages. However,
there are additional tools such as range function unique to python. The objective of the program
written in this directory was to build my understanding on control of program flow.

### The aim is to understand:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- Why indentation is so important in Python
- How to use the *if, if ... else* statements
- How to use comments
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use the while and for loops
- How is Python's *for* different from C's?
- How to use the break and continues statements
- How to use else clauses on loops
- What does the pass statement do, and when to use it
- How to use range
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What does return a function that does not use any return statement
- Scope of variables
- What's a traceback
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
