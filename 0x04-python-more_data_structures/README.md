# Python - More data structures: Set, Dictionary

Set is a collection of unordered unique objects. A dictionary is simply a collection of
key-value pairs. Unlike lists and tuple, ets and disctionaries are not sequences, they
can't be accessed by numeric indexes.<br />
This directory was created to help me practice on using these data types
