## Learning Python Programming

### Description

Python is a high level programming language that is very versatile. It can be used to automate tasks on a computer, create web applications,
analyse big data, write small custom domains or specialised GUI applications. Since python is a compiled language, a considerable amount of
time is save during program development since no compilation or linking is necessary. With python one can split program into modules that
can be reused in other programs. Python isn't strongly typed - meaning data types for variable and return types aren't explicitly stated.
This implies that fewer error are caught at compile time.
